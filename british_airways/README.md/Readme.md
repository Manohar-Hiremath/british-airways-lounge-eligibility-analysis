    "*British Airways Lounge Eligibility Modeling – Data Science Project*\n",
    "\n",
    "---> Overview\n",
    "This project models lounge eligibility for British Airways passengers at Heathrow Terminal 3. The objective is to forecast lounge demand by estimating how many travelers qualify for different lounge tiers based on flight characteristics. The results help support future capacity planning and improve operational decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 10,000 flight records with fields such as time of day, haul type, arrival region, seat distribution, and tier-wise eligible passenger counts. Using this data, a reusable lookup table is created that estimates the share of passengers eligible for Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 lounges.\n",

    "---> Objective\n",
    "To build a scalable model that:\n",
    "+ Groups flights using broad categories (time of day, haul type, region).\n",
    "++ Estimates the proportion of passengers eligible for premium lounges.\n",
    "+++ Creates a lookup table BA can apply to future unknown flight schedules.\n",
    "++++ Visualizes lounge tier distribution for insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---> Methodology\n",
    "1. Data Loading\n",
    "The flight schedule dataset is imported using Pandas. Initial checks include:\n",
    "Dataset shape\n",
    "Column overview\n",
    "Missing value detection\n",
    "Data type inspection\n",
    "This ensures the dataset is clean and suitable for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Exploration\n",
    "Exploration focuses on:\n",
    "Time-of-day distribution\n",
    "Haul type (Short/Long)\n",
    "Arrival region grouping\n",
    "Seat configuration\n",
    "Tier eligibility counts\n",
    "This helps determine which grouping variables will be effective for scalable modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Grouping & Aggregation\n",
    "Flights are grouped by:\n",
    "TIME_OF_DAY\n",
    "HAUL\n",
    "ARRIVAL_REGION\n",
    "For each group, the average number of eligible passengers is computed:\n",
    "Avg_Tier1_Pax\n",
    "Avg_Tier2_Pax\n",
    "Avg_Tier3_Pax\n",
    "These averages form the base of the eligibility model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Lookup Table Generation\n",
    "Percentages for each lounge tier are calculated using:\n",
    "TierX_% = (Avg_TierX_Pax / Total_Pax) × 100\n",
    "The final lookup table includes:\n",
    "Time of Day\n",
    "Haul Type\n",
    "Arrival Region\n",
    "Tier 1 %\n",
    "Tier 2 %\n",
    "Tier 3 %\n",
    "This table is rounded and exported as\n",
    "📄 BA_Lounge_Eligibility_Lookup.xlsx\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Visualization\n",
    "A professional bar chart is created showing:\n",
    "Eligible passengers per lounge tier\n",
    "The chart is saved inside:\n",
    "BA_Visualization/BA_Lounge_Tiers_BarChart.png\n",
    "This helps visually interpret how demand varies across lounge tiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---> Tools & Technologies\n",
    "Python\n",
    "Pandas & NumPy\n",
    "Matplotlib\n",
    "Seaborn\n",
    "Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "---> Key Insights\n",
    "+ Long-haul routes have the highest premium lounge eligibility.\n",
    "++Tier 3 (Club Lounge) demand is consistently the highest due to the large number of business-class and eligible economy travelers.\n",
    "+++Evening departures show increased traffic in mid-tier lounges.\n",
    "++++The lookup table is flexible and can be applied to future flight schedules without modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---> Conclusion\n",
    "This project successfully creates a scalable data-driven model for estimating lounge demand at Heathrow Terminal 3. By grouping flights using broad categories and calculating tier eligibility percentages, the model enables British Airways to make informed decisions regarding lounge capacity, staffing, and service planning for future schedules."
